The name **Karag√∂z** refers to 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karag%C3%B6z_and_Hacivat" target="_blank">Karag√∂z and Hacivat</a>‚Üó, 
the lead characters of the traditional Turkish shadow play, popularized during the Ottoman period and then spread to most nation states of the Ottoman Empire.

It seemed fitting as a name considering that:
*  I'm Syrian and this art is part of my heritage. 
* The function of this toolset is for the curator to use the provided components to tell a story with code.
 
Besides, naming things is hard and I was happy to find a unique name and an available domain üòÖ

So, give it a try & happy coding!
