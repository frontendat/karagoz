The name **Karag√∂z** refers to 
<a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karag%C3%B6z_and_Hacivat" target="_blank">Karag√∂z and 
Hacivat</a>, 
the lead characters of the traditional Turkish shadow play, popularized during the Ottoman period and then spread to most nation states of the Ottoman Empire.

It seemed fitting as a name considering that:
*  I'm Syrian and this art is part of my heritage. 
* The function of this toolset is for the curator to use the provided components to tell a story with code.
 
Besides, naming things is hard. I was happy to find a unique name and an available domain name üòÖ

:html-tag{tag='h3' content='But, why Vue.js?'}

My initial thought was to create a bunch of 
<a class="external" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components" target="_blank"> Web 
Components</a> that can be used in any context. However, I quickly ran into the hurdles of my limited experience 
with the technology and high level or required interactivity and reactivity.

For that reason, as well as, Vue.js being my preferred framework, I opted to create the components specifically for 
it (at least for the time being).

A Web Component build using Vue and Vite is still possible, but it might have introduced challenges that I'm not 
ready to tackle at the moment.

So, give it a try & happy coding!
