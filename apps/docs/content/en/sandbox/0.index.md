# Karagäz Sandbox

The idea behind Karagöz Sandbox is to provide a simple UI to work with 
<a href="https://webcontainers.io/" target="_blank">WebContainers</a>.

If you're not familiar with WebContainers, please check out 
<a href="https://webcontainer-tutorial.pages.dev/" target="_blank">this tutorial</a>.

In short, it is a browser-based runtime developed by StackBlitz. Once you boot a WebContainer in the browser, you 
can mount a collection of files within it and spawn processes such as installing dependencies and starting a 
development server using shell or your favorite package manager(NPM, PNPM and Yarn come preinstalled).

With Karagöz Sandbox on top of that, you will get something like the following:

::hint
Due to limitations set in the design of the WebContainer API, **only one** WebContainer instance can be running at a 
time. 
Because of that, starting one of the demos on one of the documentation pages will terminate any previously running demos.
::

::demo-runner
:sandbox-demo-defaults
::

Karagöz Sandbox stands on the shoulders of giants to provide as simple, intuitive UI.

Aside from WebContainers, it uses <a href="https://codemirror.net/" target="_blank">CodeMirror</a> for code editing and
<a href="https://xtermjs.org/" target="_blank">Xterm.js</a> to interact with the terminal and display the output of 
running processes.
