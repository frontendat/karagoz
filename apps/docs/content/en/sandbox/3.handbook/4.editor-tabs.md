# Editor Tabs

You can interact with editor tabs by accessing the `editorTabs` property on the sandbox instance;
which is also used internally for interactions between the explorer and editor tabs.

## Opening Files

The main use case for that is opening files for editing after ensuring the files are mounted.

```ts
await container.mount(/* FileSystemTree or snapshot */)
await sandbox.bootstrap()

sandbox.editorTabs.open(
  // File path, will be used as a unique ID as well.
  './public/index.html',
  
  // Optional label to by display for the editor tab.
  // If not provided the file name will be extracted 
  // from the path and used as a label.
  'HOME PAGE',
  
  // Optional context. 
  // Currently only supports suppressClose to hide the close button,
  // prventing the user from closing the tab.
  {
    suppressClose: true,
  }
)
```

Opening a file that is already open simply re-focuses the relevant editor tab.

Opening a readonly file (matched by `sandbox.explorer.readonly`) shows a lock icon next to the tab label and 
prevents changing the file contents in the editor.

## Closing Files

Editor tabs can also be programmatically closed by providing the file path.

```ts
sandbox.editorTabs.close('./public/index.html')
```

## Additional Functionality

You can learn more about additional `editorTabs` functionality in the
[API Reference](/sandbox/api-reference/functions/usesandbox#editortabs).

Some of that is also demonstrated in the example below.
